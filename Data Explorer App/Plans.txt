Things to Do for Shiny App:

Data Upload:
> Make the checkboxes for the .tif upload tab dynamic (after entering in a data type, it will display in the checkbox to ensure consistency)


Data Define: 
> Make the data retrieve function work (with raster layers) - Make sure you rm the rasterLayers after to not take up too much memory


Data Visual:
> Figure out what to display
